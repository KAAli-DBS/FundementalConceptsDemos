// 3. Polymorphism with Interfaces
// Though JavaScript doesnâ€™t have formal interfaces like languages such as TypeScript or Java, 
// it can achieve a similar effect through object polymorphism.
// You can create different objects that share the same method names but have distinct implementations, 
// allowing them to be used interchangeably.
